# What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1. code completion

1. syntax
highlighting

1. a nice variety of themes to reduce eye strain and
fatigue

1. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them. You might find some other
features that are must-have’s, but I think these features are a good
start.

## What do the following commands do?

1. pwd

* It simply shows the folder you are currently in when using a terminal or shell.

1. ls

* ls is a command used in many command-line environments to list files and folders in the current directory.

1. cd

* It's a command used in terminals to use into different folders.

1. mkdir

* Make Directory, It is a command used in terminals to create a new folder.

1. touch

* Create an empty file, It’s mainly used by developers to quickly create new files from the terminal.

## Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line?

* cd projects= “Move into the folder named projects that is inside my current directory.”
* mkdir new-project= “Create a new folder named new-project in the directory I’m currently in.”
* touch new-project/newfile.md= “Inside the folder new-project, create a file named newfile.md.”
* cd ..= “Move up one folder from where I am right now.”
* ls projects/new-project= “Show me all files and folders inside the projects/new-project directory.”
